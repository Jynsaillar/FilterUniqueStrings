# FilterUniqueStrings
Small GUI program for filtering distinct strings from a list of strings. Runs on WinForms, C#.

## Prerequisites
* .NET Framework 4.7.2

## How to
* Open the program and enter some words, one word per line.  
Enter new words on the first line, hit return and move back to the first line to add words.  
Duplicated words will be removed (i.e. only one instance of a word will remain in the list).
* On closing the program, the program will save the current list of words in its working directory in a file called `filterList.txt`.
